This is a simple tictactoe AI made in python/pyscript using the minimax algorithm which can be played against [here](https://msr8.github.io/tictactoe). There are 3 available modes:

- **Player VS Player:** No bot involved
- **Player VS AI:** Player moves first
- **AI VS Player:** Bot moves first

Made this project to try my hand at pyscript as well as the minimax algorithm
